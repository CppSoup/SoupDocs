# Soup - Getting Started

## Goals
* Just works - The primary goal of Soup is to work for all projects, big and small. It should be as simple as running two commands to setup a new project and running a build, and it should integrate easily with the largest of existing projects.
* Cross Platform - No Open Source package manager is worth its salt without being able to build and run on any and all operating systems.
* Build Agnostic - Must allow for easy integration with any build system.
